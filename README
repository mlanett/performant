Records four fundamental performance metrics:

The observation interval under observation.
The number of operations in the interval.
The total time during which operations resided in the system — the “busy time.”
The total execution time of all operations — the “weighted time.”

What is this good for? We can use these together with Little’s Law to derive these additional four long-term average metrics:

Throughput: divide the number of queries in the observation interval by the length of the interval.
Execution time: divide the weighted time by the number of queries in the interval.
Concurrency: divide the weighted time by the length of the interval.
Utilization: divide the busy time by the length of the interval.


Redis Keys:

Performant:Kind:Running     < SortedSet < ID sorted by Start time > >
Performant:Kind:Operations  < integer >
Performant:Kind:Busy Time   < float >
Performant:Kind:Work Time   < float >
Performant:Kind:Last Tick   < float >

Intervals for rollups:
  1 second for at least the past 1 minute (60...120 records)
  1 minute for at least the past hour (60..120 records)
  hourly for at least the past 3 days (72...144 records)
  daily for the past 90 days (90...180 records)
